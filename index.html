			<h4 class="quote">Fastnachts</h4>
			<p class="quote">Crispy fried yeast-risen doughnuts with dense, most middles—fasnachts are made with potatoes and other simple ingredients. They are served on Shrove Tuesday or Fasnacht Day, the day before Ash Wednesday. The term fasnacht is a combination of the verb fasten (to fast) and nacht (night). Fasnachts were traditionally prepared in an effort to empty the pantry of items such as sugar, lard, and butter before Lent.</p>
			<p class="quote">Typically tossed in granulated or powdered sugar, nowadays you can find fasnachts with icing and fruit fillings similar to doughnuts. Traditionally, however, they were left plain. Often square in shape, meant to represent the four gospels of the Bible, round and triangular versions also exist.</p>

			<p><span class="first-character">F</span>Food is abundant and appetites are hearty in the Pennsylvania Dutch country. The traditional dishes are relatively simple and unlike most regional cookery the ingredients are readily available. PA Dutch cooking is truly a folk art requiring much intuitive knowledge, for recipes contained measurements such as “flour to stiffen,” “butter the size of a walnut,” and “large as an apple.” Many of the recipes have been made more exact and standardized providing us with a regional cookery we can all enjoy. Best of all, no matter who makes the recipes, the results are wonderful good!</p>
			<p>This app was designed to bring traditional Pennsylvania Dutch cookery to people everywhere. Features include a visual menu that is organized by categories and can be filtered by dietary restrictions, level of difficulty, or time required. You can search by recipe names or ingredients, as well as keep a shopping list for items you're missing. Featured recipes include information about seasonally relevant cookery and you can save your favorites to easily access later.</p>
